Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(n ^ m) where n is the number of possibilities for each square in our case, it is 9( numbers 1 - 9).
m is the number of spaces that are blank.

Our time equation for the Backtracking Algorithm is T(m) = 9*T(m-1) + O(1)
Solving this recurrence will yield, O(9^m) also denoted as O(n^m).

In our puzzle:

  m = 18 empty cells,
  From the graph, a puzzle with 18 empty cells takes roughly 0.54557100045494735seconds.
  T(m) = 0.54557100045494735 milliseconds


Space Complexity

We need to fill in 81 cells in a 9*9 sudoku and at each level, only one cell is filled.

So, space complexity would be O(m).
In the graph, the space complexity is nearly constant but increases linearly when the number of empty cells in the
puzzle increase.
