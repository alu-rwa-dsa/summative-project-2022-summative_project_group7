**Introduction** \
In order to create cheaper, medically proven alternatives that  are easily accessible to patients living with dementia across the African Continent, we , group 7 members sort out to develop a user-friendly sudoku game that would help in improving their cognitive skills. To implement the project, we compartmentalized it and assigned each a particular task, as follows:

**Group Members:** 
1. Clare Kanja
2. Leticia Darko
3. Mukantwari Francoise
4. Nicole Moyo
5. John Thuo

**Collective  Group Tasks** 
- Selecting the project to work on
- Research and resource sharing
- Presentation Discussion and Filming
